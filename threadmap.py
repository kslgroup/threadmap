# Description:
# Threadmap plugin helps you map the process's threads'
# entry points in memory. This is done by extracting Win32StartAddress
# from the _ETHREAD and try to match it to a vad or kernel space.
# By using kernel objects to check the entry point we can
# detect any user mode memory manipulation and unattended
# kernel manipulations as well.
#
# The plugin will output suspicious threads and processes that match our rules:
#
# [*] Any process that doesn't have at least one thread that points
# to the process's mapped image file will be considered
# suspicious (Process Hollowing attacks can be found this way).
# A suspended thread that points to the process's image
# file doesn't count as mapped thread.
#
# [*] Any thread that points to an exe file that is not the
# process's image file will be considered suspicious
#
# [*] Any thread that is mapped to a vad without a file object
# will be considered suspicious. Most cases of injected code
# allocate memory by creating a vad that is not mapped to an image file
# (Good for finding code injection and process hollowing).
#
# [*] Any thread is mapped to a vad with a file object, but the type
# of the file isn't IMAGE_FILE. When initializing a process or loading
# a dll "in the natural way" the windows system maps a vad with the right
# flags. Attackers who attempt to mimic that action by loading an PE file
# as a mapped object using windows API wouldn't be able to map it as
# an IMAGE_FILE.
#
# [*] Suspicious JMP or CALLS withing the first 12 bytes (3-4 orders)
# that send the thread to another vad will be considered suspicious.
# Using a JMP and CALL are used in process hollowing and code injection
# when an attacker sends the running thread to his allocated memory
# (Good for finding code injection and process hollowing).
